Answer to technical questions
- How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
    -- spent approximately 2.5 hours
    -- Next thing I would do if I have some more time is 
    a. I have included minimal tests to demonstrate the understanding of tests. I would like to add tests for actions, for each one of the components separately
    b. Try to include more of latest react

- What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
 -- Unsafe lifecycle methods renamed in React. React has given us a headsup that the lifecycle methods that were considered unsafe would be renamed in a future 16.x release and the old names removed completely from the 17.x series. As a best practice, I wanted to start NOT using the these deprecated lifecycle methods. As an attempt to this, I have tried not using the method in Search.jsx (commented it out to show how I would have done it otherwise). I am trying to get back to working on React (after working on Emberjs and some Vuejs) after 1.5 years. So I am sure I will have more to catch up on.

- How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
 -- Have not faced a performance issue in production. Has been mostly caught in pre-production.
---
- How would you improve the API that you just used?
-- Not all the details are always required in the API for each restaurant. I would make the response slimmer and provide one version that only returns minimal properties or the properties the consumer is interested in.
